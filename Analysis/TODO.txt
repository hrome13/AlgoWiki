(DONE) 1. For ___ Improvements Heatmaps
    - Flip the x-axis (worse on left)
    - Move x-ticks to top

(DONE) 2. Create new heatmap showing only the jumps from first algorithm to best algorithm

3. For the Pareto graphs
    - Draw the frontier with a line ?

(DONE) 4. Create a 100% histogram showing parcentage of problems with an optimal algorithm over time
    - See ipad drawing (% with tradeoff, % with optimal)

(DONE) 5. Make the Pareto examples pretty
    - Clean up titles and years
    - denote parallel/quantum algorithms differently

(DONE) 6. Pie charts
    - Recreate the pie charts from Emily's paper but with space (EXCEL)

(DONE) 7. Make the Space Analysis Per Decade chart but with Percentages

(DONE) 8. Histogram of the implied lower bound powers

9. Fix hist_improvements()
