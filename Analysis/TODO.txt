(DONE) 1. For ___ Improvements Heatmaps
    - Flip the x-axis (worse on left)
    - Move x-ticks to top

(DONE) 2. Create new heatmap showing only the jumps from first algorithm to best algorithm

3. For the Pareto graphs
    - Draw the frontier with a line ?

(DONE) 4. Create a 100% histogram showing percentage of problems with an optimal algorithm over time
    - See ipad drawing (% with tradeoff, % with optimal)

(DONE) 5. Make the Pareto examples pretty
    - Clean up titles and years
    - denote parallel/quantum algorithms differently

(DONE) 6. Pie charts
    - Recreate the pie charts from Emily's paper but with space (EXCEL)

(DONE) 7. Make the Space Analysis Per Decade chart but with Percentages

(DONE) 8. Histogram of the implied lower bound powers

9. Fix hist_improvements()

10. Fix heat_size_of_improvements()

11. Fix hist_space_and_time_improvements_per_decade()

(DONE) 12. try a version of the pareto examples where you:
    - drop the parallel implementations
    -drop the decade coloring and legend
    -put arrows going from chronologically first to second, second to third, etc.

(DONE) 13. On all versions with a legend, switch 2010’s to 2010s, 2000’s to 2000s, etc.

(DONE?) 14. On versions put “Space Complexity (Augmented)”  @Jayson Lynch: please advise if another label would be better

(DONE) 15. On space analysis per decade:
    -drop decimal places and drop bolding from bar labels
    -use colors in line with charts from time complexity paper
    -cut off y-axis at 100%
    -change title to Percentage of algorithm papers with space complexity analysis (and drop y-axis title)
    -move legend off the bars
    -get the various font sizes more similar

(DONE) 16. For Problems with Space-Time…
    -same changes from other histogram, plus…
    -change title to: Time complexity – space complexity tradeoffs
    -change legend categories to “Single algorithm optimal” and “Time-space tradeoff”
    -is what is shown the flow of new algorithms or the stock of all existing?

(DONE) 17. For Proportion of Algorithms that Improve…
    -Try changing to a pie chart, using same colors as lower bounds paper
    -List as percentages
